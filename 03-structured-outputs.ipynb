    "# 📊 Structured Outputs: Turning Text into Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** Imagine you're building a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. Every day, you receive hundreds of emails from customers with their contact information, requests, and feedback. Manually copying this data into your database would take hours. What if AI could automatically extract names, emails, phone numbers, and requests into a structured format you can directly save to your database?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the power of **structured outputs** — getting AI to return data in a predictable, machine-readable format like JSON.\n",

    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "- Extract structured data from unstructured text\n",
    "- Use JSON mode for reliable data extraction\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You now understand how to extract structured data from text:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **JSON Mode** - Guarantees valid JSON output\n",
    "2. **Pydantic** - Adds type safety and validation\n",
    "3. **Multiple Entities** - Extract lists of items\n",
    "4. **Nested Structures** - Handle complex data hierarchies\n",
    "5. **Real-world Applications** - Invoice processor, email analyzer, review parser\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Temperature | Validation | Notes |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|------------|-------|\n",
    "| Contact Extraction | Low (0.2) | Pydantic | Accuracy is critical |\n",
    "| Invoice Processing | Low (0.2) | Pydantic + Math | Verify calculations |\n",
    "| Review Analysis | Medium (0.5) | Pydantic | Some interpretation needed |\n",
    "| Resume Parsing | Low (0.3) | Pydantic | Consistent format important |\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always validate**: Don't trust AI outputs blindly\n",
    "- **Handle missing data**: Use `Optional` fields in Pydantic\n",
    "- **Test edge cases**: What if the text is ambiguous?\n",
    "- **Low temperature**: Use 0.2-0.3 for consistent extraction\n",
    "- **Clear prompts**: Specify exact field names and formats\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combine** with vision AI to extract data from images\n",
    "- **Add** error handling for failed extractions\n",
    "- **Build** a complete data pipeline (extract → validate → save to database)\n",
    "- **Experiment** with different models and compare accuracy\n",
