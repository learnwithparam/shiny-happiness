      "\n",
      "*   **Functionality:** Describe what the code is intended to do.\n",
      "*   **Input Validation:** Identify potential problematic inputs.\n",
      "*   **Edge Cases:** Consider specific scenarios that might lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
      "*   **Error Handling:**  Determine if the code handles errors gracefully.\n",

      "\n",
      "**3. Solving Each Step**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Functionality:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    The function `divide_list` takes a list of numbers (`numbers`) and a divisor (`divisor`) as input. It iterates through the `numbers` list, divides each number by the `divisor`, and appends the result to a new list called `result`. Finally, it returns the `result` list.  Essentially, it performs element-wise division of a list by a scalar.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Input Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **`numbers` is not a list:** If `numbers` is not a list (e.g., a string, a number, `None`), the `for num in numbers:` loop will raise a `TypeError`.\n",
      "    *   **`numbers` contains non-numeric values:** If the `numbers` list contains elements that are not numbers (e.g., strings, booleans), the `num / divisor` operation will raise a `TypeError`.\n",
      "    *   **`divisor` is not a number:** If `divisor` is not a number, the `num / divisor` operation will raise a `TypeError`.\n",
      "    *   **`divisor` is zero:** If `divisor` is zero, the `num / divisor` operation will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Edge Cases:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **`numbers` is an empty list:** If `numbers` is an empty list (`[]`), the function will execute without errors and return an empty list. This is generally acceptable behavior.\n",
      "    *   **`numbers` contains `inf` or `nan`:** If the list contains `float('inf')` or `float('nan')`, the division will result in `inf` or `nan` values in the output list. This might be acceptable depending on the use case, but it's worth considering.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Error Handling:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    The code does *not* explicitly handle any errors.  If any of the `TypeError` or `ZeroDivisionError` exceptions occur, the program will crash unless the calling code has a `try...except` block to catch them.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Improvements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    1.  **Input Validation:** Add checks to ensure that `numbers` is a list and that both `numbers` elements and `divisor` are numeric.\n",
      "    2.  **Zero Division Handling:**  Handle the case where `divisor` is zero.  Options include:\n",
      "        *   Raising a custom exception.\n",
      "        *   Returning a special value (e.g., `float('inf')` or `None`).\n",
      "        *   Returning the original list or a list of `None` values.\n",
      "    3.  **Docstring:** Add a docstring to explain what the function does, its parameters, and its return value.\n",
      "    4.  **List Comprehension (Optional):** For conciseness, the code can be rewritten using a list comprehension.\n",
      "    5.  **Type Hints:** Add type hints for better readability and static analysis.\n",

      "**Step 4: Identify what matters most**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the most subjective step. The decision hinges on the individual's priorities:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Risk Tolerance:** Are you comfortable with the high risk of a startup?\n",
      "*   **Financial Situation:** Do you need the higher salary *before* cost of living adjustment, or are you willing to take a lower salary for more stability and potentially similar buying power in Austin? Do you have savings to weather a potential job loss?\n",
      "*   **Career Goals:** Do you prioritize rapid career growth and learning, or a more stable and predictable career path?\n",
      "*   **Lifestyle:** Do you prefer the vibrant, fast-paced lifestyle of San Francisco, or the more relaxed atmosphere of Austin?\n",
      "*   **Equity Value:** How much do you believe in the startup's potential?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 5: Provide a reasoned recommendation**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation:** This is where I make a recommendation based on possible scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Scenario 1: Risk-Averse, Prioritizes Stability and Work-Life Balance:**  **Job B (Austin)** is the better choice. The lower cost of living will likely offset the salary difference, and the established company offers greater job security and a more predictable career path.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Scenario 2: High Risk Tolerance, Prioritizes Potential for High Reward and Rapid Growth, Believes in the Startup:** **Job A (San Francisco)** is the better choice. The equity could be very valuable if the company succeeds, and the startup environment offers opportunities for rapid learning and career advancement. However, be prepared for long hours, high stress, and the possibility of job loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Scenario 3: Moderate Risk Tolerance, Wants a Balance:** This is the hardest.  The key is to research the *specific* cost of living difference between San Francisco and Austin.  If the cost of living difference is *significant* (e.g., $20k+ per year), Job B is still likely better. If the difference is smaller (e.g., $10k or less), Job A becomes more attractive, *especially* if you believe in the product and the team.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations Before Making a Final Decision:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Research:** Use cost of living calculators to compare the actual cost of living in San Francisco and Austin. Research the startup (Job A) thoroughly. Look at their funding, team, and product.\n",
      "*   **Talk to Employees:** If possible, talk to current or former employees of both companies to get a better understanding of the company culture and work environment.\n",
      "*   **Negotiate:** Attempt to negotiate a higher salary or more equity with either company.\n",
