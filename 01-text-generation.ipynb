      "\n",
      "*   `my_decorator` is the decorator function. It takes another function (`func`) as an argument.\n",
      "*   `wrapper` is a nested function inside the decorator. It's what gets executed before and after the original function.\n",
      "*   `@my_decorator` is the syntax for applying the decorator to the `say_hello` function.\n",

      "👋 Hello!\n",
      "🎈 After the function runs!\n",

      "[Question]: What is a Python decorator?\n",
      "\n",
      "✓ Professional Expert:\n",
      "A Python decorator is a syntactic sugar that allows you to modify or enhance the functionality of a function or method in a clean and readable way. It's essentially a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and returns a modified version of that function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technically, a decorator is applied using the `@` symbol followed by the decorator function name directly above the function definition you want to modify.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How it works:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  The decorator function receives the decorated function as an argument.\n",
      "2.  Inside the decorator, you define a wrapper function. This wrapper can add functionality like logging, timing, authentication, or input validation *before* or *after* the original function is executed.\n",
      "3.  The decorator function returns the wrapper function.  Now, when the decorated function is called, the wrapper function is executed instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def my_decorator(func):\n",
