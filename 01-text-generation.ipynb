      "*   `@my_decorator` above `say_hello` is the decorator syntax. It's equivalent to `say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)`.\n",

      "[Question:] What is a Python decorator?\n",
      "\n",
      "\u2713 Professional Expert:\n",
      "A Python decorator is a syntactic sugar that enables you to modify or enhance a function or method's behavior without altering its core code. It's implemented using the `@` symbol followed by the decorator function's name, placed directly above the function/method definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technically, a decorator is a callable (usually a function) that takes another function as input, performs some operation on it, and returns a modified version of the original function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key aspects:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Function as Argument:** Decorators accept functions as arguments.\n",
      "*   **Wrapper Function:** They often use a \"wrapper\" function inside to add functionality before/after the original function's execution.\n",
      "*   **Return Modified Function:**  They return the wrapper function, effectively replacing the original function with the modified one.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def my_decorator(func):\n",
      "    def wrapper():\n",
      "        print(\"Before function call\")\n",
      "        func()\n",
