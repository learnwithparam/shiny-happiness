      "✓ Professional Expert:\n",
      "A Python decorator is a syntactic sugar that allows you to modify or enhance a function or method's behavior in a reusable way. Essentially, it's a callable that takes a function as input, adds some functionality, and returns a modified function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mechanism:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Function as Argument:** Decorators accept a function as an argument.\n",
      "2.  **Wrapper Function:**  They define a \"wrapper\" function inside, which encapsulates the original function.\n",
      "3.  **Enhanced Behavior:** The wrapper function can execute code *before* and/or *after* calling the original function.  This is where the added functionality resides (e.g., logging, timing, authentication).\n",
      "4.  **Return Value:** The decorator *returns* the wrapper function (or a modified version of it), effectively replacing the original function with the enhanced version.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Syntax:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The `@` symbol is used to apply a decorator above a function definition.  `@decorator_name` is equivalent to `my_function = decorator_name(my_function)`.\n",
